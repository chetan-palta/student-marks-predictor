# üìä Student Performance Predictor

A machine learning mini-project that predicts students' marks using features like hours studied, attendance, sleep habits, past performance, and more. This project includes data exploration, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## üîç Project Overview
- Predicts **Marks Obtained** based on real-life academic and behavioral indicators
- Built using **Linear Regression** on an extended dataset
- Visual insights via correlation heatmaps and prediction plots
- Archived v1 notebook (basic model) for comparison

## ‚öôÔ∏è ML Workflow
1. Load and inspect dataset
2. Perform EDA (correlation heatmap, top features)
3. Train-test split
4. Train a Linear Regression model
5. Evaluate using MSE and R¬≤ score
6. Visualize predictions vs actual marks

## üì¶ Future Additions
- Streamlit-based UI for predictions
- Model comparison: Random Forest, Ridge, Lasso, XGBoost
- Feature selection & cross-validation
- `requirements.txt` and deployment-ready packaging

---
